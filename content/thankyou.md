Thank you *so much* for donating and helping to support the work that I'm doing! Donations (no matter the size) go a long ways towards encouraging me, showing the the work I do is valuable to people like yourself, and helping me to carve out more time to contribute.

Please don't hesitate to reach out via [Signal, SimpleX, Threema, or Nostr]({{< ref "/content/about.md#how-to-contact-me" >}}), I'd love to hear what you found useful, why, and a little bit more about how you stumbled across my work!

Thanks again, and keep up the good work supporting people who are giving of their free time to further causes they care deeply about.
