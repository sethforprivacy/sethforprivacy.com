# Introduction

Bitcoin is often touted as a fungible and private asset and digital cash alternative, when in fact it is technically non-fungible. Each bitcoin in circulation has a distinct history attached to it ensuring that 1 BTC is not equal to 1 BTC. While coin histories can be somewhat obfuscated with tools like CoinJoin, the fungibility of Bitcoin remains distinctly lacking. This lack of fungibility imposes an immense burden on those using Bitcoin as a method of exchange (MoE), introduces a permissioned and centralized layer to the network, and destroys the confidence of everyone accepting funds in Bitcoin.

Many Bitcoiners purport that fungibility can be gained through more users mixing, or by peer-pressuring and boycotting exchanges and services that flag or trace Bitcoin transactions. In theory this is possible (suppose in another universe, everyone mixes), but why leave it up to chance?

The Monero community sees fungibility as a basic safety feature. Good tools should include safety features by default, strong enough to withstand both governmental and social attacks. This is far preferable to relying on the good will of governments and regulators, or the peer-pressure of us as users to ensure fungibility of digital cash. Do you really want your coins to be fungible only if everyone in Bitcoin correctly follows a 36h-long privacy guide?

Monero relies on privacy by default, for all users and all transactions, to ensure that 1 XMR is equal to 1 XMR, no matter what. Monero is fungible today, not just in a pipe dream.

# The Fungibility Graveyard

This concern isn't only a fun thought exercise, unfortunately, as users of Bitcoin privacy tools are being harassed today.

Below is a list of sources confirming cases of flagging, denied withdrawals, denied deposits, and censorship by services because of a distinct lack of fungibility within Bitcoin. The list is broken down by the tool or reason for the flagging or censorship.

## Compliant Mining and "Virgin" Bitcoin

- Marathon Digital Holdings Inc. launches a mining pool "that is fully compliant with U.S. regulations, including anti-money laundering (AML) and the Office of Foreign Asset Control’s (OFAC’s) standards":
  - "We believe that such regulatory compliant mining will allow us to produce ‘clean’ Bitcoin."
  - "On May 1, 2021, Marathon will begin directing 100% of its hashrate to the new mining pool."
  - "By 2022, Marathon expects to have deployed 103,120 miners to direct 10.37 exahashes per second, or EH/s, to the mining pool — equal to roughly 6.4% of the Bitcoin network’s current combined hash rate."
  - "[Will] be the seventh largest bitcoin mining pool in the world."

- Bitcoin mined in China or via fossil fuels are not acceptable to institutional investors:
