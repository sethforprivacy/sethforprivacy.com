If you've enjoyed my work and would like to give me a little more time to dedicate to it, I'll happily take any Monero or Bitcoin you'd like to throw my way:

## Monero or Bitcoin/Lightning via BTCPay Server

You can easily donate Bitcoin (on-chain or via Lightning) or Monero via my BTCPay Server instance:

{{< btcpayserver >}}

## Bitcoin via BIP 353 username

BIP 353 adoption is on the rise, and I'm loving it so far. For an easy way to tip me in wallets that support it, simply enter `tips@sethforprivacy.com` to pay via Silent Payments or LN via BOLT 12.

For more on setting up your own username, check out the guide [here]({{< ref "content/guides/setting-up-a-bitcoin-username.md" >}}).

## Lightning via Lightning Address

You can easily donate Bitcoin via Lightning to my Lightning Address:

## Bitcoin via Silent Payments

If you're already jumping on the Silent Payments train and have a wallet that supports sending to a Silent Payment address, a fantastic way to donate and support my work is using the privacy-preserving Silent Payment address below:
