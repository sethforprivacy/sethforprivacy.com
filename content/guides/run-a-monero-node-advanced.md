# Introduction

With the [ongoing network attacks in Monero]({{< ref "/posts/moneros-ongoing-network-attack.md" >}}), it's a great time for users to dive into running their [own node](https://www.monerooutreach.org/monero_best_practices/your_own_node.html).

In this short post I'll detail how to easily run a Monero node on a Linux server, the most common OS for virtual private servers (VPS). I would highly recommend running either Debian or Ubuntu for your Linux distribution, and this guide will assume you are running one of those.

I will also assume in this guide that you have purchased and SSH'd into the VPS/host of your choosing, but if you need help with those first steps here are a few good links to follow:

- [Hosting services accepting Monero](https://www.getmonero.org/community/merchants/#hosting)
  - These are some options available for hosting a VPS while paying with Monero, and each come with pro's and con's.
- [Joe's Datacenter](https://joesdatacenter.com/)
  - A solid and cheap VPS and dedicated server provider based out of the US, they accept Bitcoin but do not accept Monero (yet!) and are a great choice for a high-performance node.
- [Simple Linode deployment guide](https://www.pragmaticlinux.com/2020/07/setup-a-minimal-debian-10-buster-server-as-a-linode-vps/)
  - If you use Linode, please consider using [my referral link](https://www.linode.com/?r=c956dbb75d14063251557a0e5003efb5ceacc74d) so we both get free credits.

If you're using your own hardware at home, this guide will still generally apply to you assuming you are running Ubuntu/Debian.

# Recommended hardware

- Full Node
  - 2+ vCPUs/cores
  - 4GB+ RAM
  - 175GB+ SSD
  
- Pruned Node[^1]
  - 2+ vCPUs/cores
  - 4GB+ RAM
  - 75GB+ SSD
        

*If you're able to get unlimited bandwidth, be sure to raise the bandwidth limits in the provided configuration files to speed up your initial sync and to provide more bandwidth to the overall Monero network.*

[^1]: A pruned node allows you to run your own Monero node without requiring as much disk space. Please see [the pruning Moneropedia entry](https://www.getmonero.org/resources/moneropedia/pruning.html) for more info.

# Why run your own Monero node?

The Monero network relies on a distributed web of Monero nodes, each of which validate transactions, propagate transactions to the rest of the network, and helps new nodes easily and quickly synchronize to the current state of the network.

Running a Monero node for yourself not only helps to give you the stronger network-level privacy guarantees, but also helps to increase the decentralization, stability, and speed of the Monero network.

Each node can expose two different services, each of which has a positive impact on the network in a unique way:

- Peer-to-Peer (p2p) port (default 18080): this port allows other nodes on the network to connect to your node to download the blockchain and to send you any transactions they validate that you do not yet have. It also increases overall network privacy, as your node participates in the [Dandelion++](https://www.monerooutreach.org/stories/dandelion.html) propagation of transactions.
- Remote Procedure Call (RPC) port (default 18089 for restricted): Exposing this port (especially with the `public-node` arg) allows other users on the network, especially those using mobile wallets or the GUI wallet in "Simple" mode, to connect to your node to sync their wallets, without needing to run their own full node locally.

In this guide I have only given configuration files and Docker commands that expose the p2p port, as that is a key help to the network. Feel free to use one of the configuration files utilizing the `public-node` arg listed below if you'd also like to advertise your restricted RPC port.

You can choose to either deploy `monerod` [as a Docker container]({{< ref "/guides/run-a-monero-node.md" >}}) or setup a node via systemd and using "official" binaries below.

*Note: If you'd like to build from source instead of downloading and verifying binaries, please checkout the [great gist from tannerdsilva](https://gist.github.com/tannerdsilva/071100b6b7f5e2903b2c4ba232bccd68).*

# Update and install required packages

First we need to install a few tools we will need later:

```bash
sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get upgrade -y
sudo apt-get install -y ufw gpg wget bzip2
```

# Initial Hardening via UFW

We will want to make sure that the system is hardened in a simple way by making sure that the firewall is locked down to only allow access to the ports necessary for SSH and `monerod`, using UFW.

A great intro to getting started with UFW is available [on DigitalOcean](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-setup-a-firewall-with-ufw-on-an-ubuntu-and-debian-cloud-server).

Run the following commands to add some basic UFW rules and enable the firewall:

```bash
# Deny all non-explicitly allowed ports
sudo ufw default deny incoming
sudo ufw default allow outgoing

# Allow SSH access
sudo ufw allow ssh

# Allow monerod p2p port
sudo ufw allow 18080/tcp

# Allow monerod restricted RPC port
sudo ufw allow 18089/tcp

# Enable UFW
sudo ufw enable
```

# Download and install monerod

Create our system user and directories for Monero configuration, PID, and log files:

```bash
# Create a system user and group to run monerod
sudo addgroup --system monero
sudo adduser --system --home /var/lib/monero --ingroup monero --disabled-login monero

# Create necessary directories for monerod
sudo mkdir /var/run/monero
sudo mkdir /var/log/monero
sudo mkdir /etc/monero

# Create monerod config file
sudo touch /etc/monero/monerod.conf

# Set permissions for new directories
sudo chown monero:monero /var/run/monero
sudo chown monero:monero /var/log/monero
sudo chown -R monero:monero /etc/monero
```

Download and verify the latest CLI binaries using my gist[^2]:

```bash
wget https://gist.githubusercontent.com/sethforprivacy/ad5848767d9319520a6905b7111dc021/raw/download_monero_binaries.sh
chmod +x download_monero_binaries.sh
./download_monero_binaries.sh
```

Install the latest binaries:

```bash
tar xvf monero-linux-*.tar.bz2
rm monero-linux-*.tar.bz2
sudo cp -r monero-x86_64-linux-gnu-*/* /usr/local/bin/
sudo chown -R monero:monero /usr/local/bin/monero*
```

# Install monerod systemd script

Installing `monerod` via a systemd script allows Monero to start automatically on boot, restart on any crash, and log to a given file.

Choose the proper configuration file depending on if you want to run a full node or a pruned node and whether you want to advertise your public restricted RPC node to allow other users to sync their wallets using your node or not:

*Note: My recommended configuration file is the first one, but feel free to choose one of the other 3 options as needed.*

Now copy and paste the configuration file you want to use:

```bash
sudo nano /etc/monero/monerod.conf
```

*To escape from the nano shell and save the file, hit `ctrl+x`.*

Simply copy the contents of the systemd script below and save it to `/etc/systemd/system/monerod.service` using vim or nano:

```systemd

[Install]
WantedBy=multi-user.target
```

```bash
sudo nano /etc/systemd/system/monerod.service
```

*To escape from the nano shell and save the file, hit `ctrl+x`.*

Then run the following to start `monerod`:
```bash
# Load the new systemd script for monerod
sudo systemctl daemon-reload

# Set monerod to start on boot
sudo systemctl enable monerod

# Start the monerod service
sudo systemctl start monerod

# Tail the monerod log
sudo tail -f /var/log/monero/monerod.log
```

You should see `monerod` start up properly there and tell you it is synchronizing with the network!

# Updating your Monero node

Whenever a new version is released, you'll want to update as soon as possible to ensure you have the latest fixes, improvements, and features available.

Download the new binaries:

```bash
cd ~
./download_monero_binaries.sh
```

Install the new binaries and restart `monerod`:

```bash
rm -rf monero-x86_64-linux-gnu-*
tar xvf monero-linux-*.tar.bz2
rm monero-linux-*.tar.bz2
sudo systemctl stop monerod
sudo cp -r monero-x86_64-linux-gnu-*/* /usr/local/bin/
sudo chown -R monero:monero /usr/local/bin/monero*
sudo systemctl start monerod
```

That will download the latest binaries, replace the old ones, and restart `monerod` with the latest version!

# Sending commands to your node

`monerod` supports sending commands locally, allowing you get additional info on the status of `monerod`, set bandwidth limits, set peer limits, etc.

A full list of commands as of `v0.17.1.8` can be found below, or by running `monerod help`:

```bash
Monero 'Oxygen Orion' (v0.17.1.8-release)
Commands: 
  alt_chain_info [blockhash]

  status
  stop_daemon
  stop_mining
  sync_info
  unban <address>
  update (check|download)
  version
```

When you want to run a command, simply run `monerod name_of_command` and it will automatically connect to the daemon, run the command, and print the output of that command to the terminal.

A few of my most commonly used commands are:

- `monerod status`: get a short output on the status of `monerod`, including peer counts (both out and in), block height, sync status, and version
- `monerod sync_info`: print a list of peers with info on their status and what syncing your node is doing with them
- `monerod print_net_stats`: print network statistics since `monerod` started, including received and sent traffic total, average rates, and the limits set
- `monerod update check`: check if an updated version of `monerod` has been released

# Port forwarding

If you decide to use this guide on a device on your home network, you will need to be sure to port forward `18080/tcp` and `18089/tcp` through your router or [use an anonymity network like Tor]({{< ref "#tor" >}}).

A good central site with a lot of guides for specific routers can be found at [portforward.com](https://portforward.com/router.htm). Just make sure to select your proper router make and model, and then open 18080/18089 for TCP only.

# Using anonymity networks

## Tor

If you would like to also expose your RPC port over Tor as a Hidden Service, follow these few commands and you're all set. This allows you to access your RPC port entirely over Tor without ever even needing to go through exit nodes.

### Install Tor

```bash
# Install the Tor daemon
sudo apt-get install tor

# Enable Tor to start on boot
sudo systemctl enable tor
```

### Create the necessary directory

```bash
sudo mkdir /var/lib/tor/hidden_service
sudo chown debian-tor:debian-tor /var/lib/tor/hidden_service
```

### Edit the torrc configuration file

```bash
# Add configuration lines to /etc/tor/torrc to enable the HiddenService for restricted RPC
echo "## Tor Monero RPC HiddenService
HiddenServiceDir /var/lib/tor/hidden_service/monero-rpc
HiddenServicePort 18089 127.0.0.1:18089" | sudo tee -a /etc/tor/torrc
```

### Restart Tor and get the HiddenService address

```bash
sudo systemctl restart tor
sudo cat /var/lib/tor/hidden_service/monero-rpc/hostname
```

The string that gets output from the last command is your new Monero RPC Hidden Service, and remember to use port `18089` when connecting to it, still! 

*Note: To test connectivity, simply visit `http://replacewithnewonionaddress:18089/get_info` and make sure you get a block of text back.*

# Connecting to your new remote node

This will depend on the wallet you've chosen to use, but usually just entails specifying the IP address of your node (either your home IP address or that of your VPS-provided host) or Onion address.

An example of how to do this in the main desktop wallet [is provided here.](https://www.getmonero.org/resources/user-guides/remote_node_gui.html)

# A few helpful Linux CLI tools

A few of my favorite tools for general Linux CLI usage are below, hopefully they will help you out getting more comfortable with the CLI or keeping a closer eye on your node!

- [Oh My Zsh](https://ohmyz.sh/)
  - A great replacement for bash/sh shells, Oh My Zsh gives much better highlighting, features, and has automatic updates over git
- [vnstat](https://humdi.net/vnstat/)
  - A simple CLI tool to watch and view bandwidth usage numbers
- [htop](https://htop.dev/)
  - Gives a great overall picture of system resource usage by process, and is much more readable than `top`
- [multitail](https://www.vanheusden.com/multitail/)
  - a much more fully-featured way to view logs (especially more than one at a time)

# Conclusion

Hopefully this guide simplified the process of setting up a remote node on a VPS, and many more similar guides should be popping up shortly.

I used the commands and info in this guide to kick off a few new remote nodes at [Joe's Datacenter], feel free to utilize them for wallet sync, add them as priority peers, etc:

`node.sethforprivacy.com:18089` (high-performance node on baremetal at Joe's Datacenter in Kansas City, Missouri)

Also available as Tor HiddenServices at:

`rbpgdckle3h3vi4wwwrh75usqtoc5r3alohy7yyx57isynvay63nacyd.onion:18089`  

Please reach out via [Signal, SimpleX, X, or Nostr]({{< ref "/about.md#how-to-contact-me" >}}) if you have any questions, think a step needs clarification, or need further help getting up and running.

Thanks!
